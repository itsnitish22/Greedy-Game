The following practices were followed while developing the app:
1. MVVM: For clean architecture and managable code.
2. NavGraphs: For easy and convenient navigations, handling fragment backstack smoothly, data transfer between fragments is easy.
3. Room Database: For following the best and efficient practices dealing with DBs. No need of boiler plate code as it works on top of SQL Lite.
4. Single Activity: Preffered by Offical Android Developers (Google) for no more defining activities in manifest. Easy navigation and data transfer between fragments. Managable workflow.
5. Retrofit: Provides all APIs for dealing with networking calls. Easy to use while parsing JSON files.
